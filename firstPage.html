    <p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing and typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been 
        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
        Lorem Ipsum.</p>
